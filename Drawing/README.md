Paintend some shapes like rectangle or oval, learned a bit about JPanel and JComponent.
Only diffrences between them that I know of so far are:

 - JComponent is transparent in default, and JPanel has default background color
 - FlowLayout is default layout manager for JPanel, JComponent doesn't have one
 - JComponent is an abstract class, JPanel is not.
